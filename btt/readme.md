# [BetterTouchTool](https://www.boastr.net)
I mainly use BTT to customize different trackpad gestures either globally or on per app basis. I also use BTT for all my window management needs.

You can find the [PDF file](./gestures.pdf) with all the custom gestures I have made together with a [downloadable Profile](https://cdn.rawgit.com/nikitavoloboev/my-mac-os/master/btt/Main.bttpreset) that you can import to your BetterTouchTool to get all gestures I setup for myself.

I also use BTT to modify my TouchBar. Here is how it looks:

It includes, from left to right:
1. My [current active TODO](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/small-workflows/tree/master/todo-task#readme)
2. Battery percentage
3. Current time and day

This is also included in the above preset.
