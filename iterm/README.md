# Monokai theme for iTerm

You can install the theme from [here](https://cdn.rawgit.com/nikitavoloboev/my-mac-os/master/iterm/Monokai.itermcolors) and open it in iTerm. Here is how it looks:

It goes well with [Pure Zsh plugin](https://github.com/sindresorhus/pure) and [Monokai theme for Vim](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/monokai-vim#readme).
