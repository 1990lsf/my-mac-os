# Hazel rules
Currently I am only sharing the rules I have set for my `~/Downloads` folder.

Some rules like `Sort books (b.)` which check if the file is a PDF or ePub and has its name starting with `b. `, it will automatically move the file to my `~/Documents/books` directory synced with iCloud won't work for you. But you can take ideas from some of these rules.

I will be adding more Hazel rules in the future.
